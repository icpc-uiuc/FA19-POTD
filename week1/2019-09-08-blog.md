##Solution to yesterday's problem  [Different is Good] (https://codeforces.com/contest/672/problem/B):

###Problem Statement:
The problem asks us to find the minimum changes to make the string has no repeated substrings.

###Observation:
We observe that in a good string all characters must be different, because all substrings of length 1 must be different. If the length of the string is greater than 26 then the answer must be  - 1 since we only have 26 different lowercase letters.</br>
Otherwise, Let's suppose we have $k$ different letters in the string of length $n$; in order to get a good string with minimum changes, $k$ characters must stay as before, the others must be changed. So the answer will be $n$—$k$.
###Implementation Process:


<spoiler summary="Code(C++)">
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n;
string s;
int cnt[26]; 

int main(){
	cin>>n;
	if(n>26) {
		cout<<-1;
	}else{
                cin>>s;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			cnt[s[i]-'a']++;
		}
		int c=0;
		for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
			if(cnt[i]>0) c++;
		}
		cout<<n-c;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

#This solution is O(n)
_ = input()
s = input()
if len(s) > 26:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(len(s) - len(set(s)))
```

###Time Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: $O(1)$.<br>
