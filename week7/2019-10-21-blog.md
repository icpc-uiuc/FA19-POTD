##Solution to yesterday's problem  [Alice and the Unfair Game](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1236/E):
###Problem Analysis:
First, we found that $(x,x)$ is always a legal solution. Also, for every starting position, the possible ending positions will form an interval. WLOG, we first consider ending positions $y>x$. So, we go through all the $x$ and find a max $y$ for them to make $(x,y)$ legal. Then, it has a contribution of $y-x$ toward the answer, which turns the problem into finding the max $y$ for every $x$.<br>
If the doll is currently in $a[i]-1$ and Alice is going to guess $a[i]$ for the next round, the doll should stop moving for one round. Let $dp[i]$ denote the total times we need to stop when we first stop at time $i$. Hence, when iterating $i$ decreasingly, we should find a smallest $j$ which is greater than $i$ such that $a[i]-1-i=a[j]-j$ and set dp[i]=dp[j]+1.<br>
For every x, we have at most $m+1$ moving chance. So that we can move it to $min(n,x+m+1-dp[i])$, where the corresponding $i$ can be found when doing the calculation above. <br>
And change the $a[i]$ into $n+1-a[i]$ and use to algorithm above for the other direction.

        mp[k + 1] = i;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        int k = mp[i];
        int T = min(n, i + m + 1 - d[k]);
        ans += T - i;
    }
    return ans;
}

    cin>>n>>m;
