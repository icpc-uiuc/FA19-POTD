##Solution to yesterday's problem [Lucky Year](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/808/A):

###Problem Analysis and Observation:
Let's denote the first digit of the current year as $f$ and the number of digits of the current year as $d$. Then it is obvious that the next lucky year is ($h+1$) $\times$ $10^{d-1}$. There are multiple ways to implement this. See the following code for details.

###Implementation Process:

<spoiler summary="Code(C++)">
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	for(int i=1e9;;i/=10)
		if(n/i){
			cout<<(n/i+1)*i-n<<endl;
			break;
		}
}
```
