##Solution to yesterday's problem [Alice and the List of Presents](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1236/B):
###Problem Analysis:
If not immediately coming up with the solution, you can first write down the following equation:$f(n, m) = f(n - 1, m) * (2^m - 1)$. That is, to add another kind of present, we only have to multiply the previous state by the number of the non-empty subsets of {1,1,...,1} $(m  1's)$. Then we find $f(n, m) = (2^m - 1)^n$ which can be solved by fast pow in $O(log(n)+log(m))$ time.

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
const int mod = 1000000007;

ll fastpow(ll a, ll b) {
    if(b==0) return 1;
    return b%2==0 ? fastpow(a*a%mod, b/2) : fastpow(a*a%mod, b/2)*a%mod;
}

int main() {
    ll n, m; cin>>n>>m;
    cout<<fastpow(fastpow(2, m)-1, n)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
