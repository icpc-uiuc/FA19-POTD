##Solution to yesterday's problem  [Mahmoud and Ehab and the wrong algorithm](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/959/C):

###Problem Analysis:
The problem solves the minimum vertex cover for a tree using a wrong algorithm and asks us to find one example which causes the algorithm to be wrong and another example which causes the algorithm to be right. Although it is irrelevant to this problem, one way to solve the minimum vertex cover on the tree is to convert the minimum vertex cover into maximum matching by Kőnig's theorem since the tree is a bipartite graph, and the maximum matching on a bipartite graph can be solved using Hungarian algorithm, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm, or just construct a graph then run Dinic on it. Another way is to do dynamic programming on the tree, which might give you an even better complexity than the algorithm for the bipartite graph mentioned above.

###Observation:
The correct example is obvious, either a star graph or a chain can make it work. After some drawings, you might see that when $n\geq6$, there are several ways to cause the algorithm to fail. One way is to connect $1$ to $2$, $2$ to $3$, $2$ to $4$ and the rest of the nodes to $1$, which makes the number of the nodes in the odd and even layers both greater than 2, but the minimum vertex cover can be done by choosing node $1$ and node $2$. And when $n\leq5$, there is no way to construct an example that make the algorithm used in this problem failed. 

###Implementation Process:
The code follows:
<spoiler summary="Code(C++)">
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	if(n<6)
		cout<<-1<<'\n';
	else{
		cout<<1<<' '<<2<<'\n';
		cout<<2<<' '<<3<<'\n';
		cout<<2<<' '<<4<<'\n';
		for(int i=5;i<=n;i++)
			cout<<1<<' '<<i<<'\n';
	}
	for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)
		cout<<i-1<<' '<<i<<'\n';
}
```

###Time Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: $O(n)$.<br>
