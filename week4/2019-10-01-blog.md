Hi, my name is Leo. Peter (@yyp690) and I will be new technical officers.

##Solution to yesterday's problem (Medium): [Marcin and Training Camp] (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1210/B):

###Solution:

Let $s_i$ be the student with the largest $a_i$ among the students we choose. There must be another student $s_j$ we choose whose algorithm set $a_j$ is the same as $a_i$. Otherwise $a_i$ is strictly larger than every other student's a-value we choose, which means for every other $a_j$, $a_i$ contains certain 1-bit that $a_j$ doesn't have.

Likewise, for any pair of students whose algorithm sets are the same, they can be chosen since they each has at least one partner who knows every algorithm she knows.

For every other student, if the algorithms she knows are all known by another student we've already chosen, she can be added to our list. Otherwise, if nobody else knows all the algorithms she knows, she would think she's the best. We sort the students according to their a-values in decreasing order, so that if one student's algorithm set isn't a subset of any other selected student's, she cannot be chosen because the remaining students' sets are smaller than hers.

Therefore, the problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$.

    for(int i=0;i<n;++i) cin>>stu[i].first;
    for(int i=0;i<n;++i) cin>>stu[i].second;
    sort(stu, stu+n);
    int idx=n-1;
    long long sum=0;
    vector<long long> algo;
    while(idx>=0){
        if(idx>0&&(stu[idx].first==stu[idx-1].first)){
            sum+=stu[idx].second+stu[idx-1].second;
            algo.push_back(stu[idx].first);
            idx-=2;
            continue;
        }
        bool b=false;
        for(int i=0;i<algo.size();++i)
            if((stu[idx].first&algo[i])==stu[idx].first){
                b=true;
                sum+=stu[idx].second;
                break;
            }
        --idx;
    }
    cout<<sum<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
