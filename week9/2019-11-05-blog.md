##Solution to yesterday's problem [Binary String Minimizing](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1256/D):

###Problem Analysis and Observation:
It's obvious that to make the string lexicographically smallest, we should make the first $0$ as front as possible, then the second $0$, and so on. However, we can not directly simulate the swapping process since $k$ could be large. One way to solve this problem within time limit is to keep track of the positions of $0$s in the string, and skip the swapping process but make the $0$ to the front at a time. In this way, our time complexity is $O(n)$ for each query.

###Implementation Process:

<spoiler summary="Code(C++)">
```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0);
	int q;
	cin>>q;
	while(q--){
		int n;
		long long int k;
		cin>>n>>k;
		string s;
		cin>>s;
		vector<int> zero;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
			if(s[i]=='0'){
				zero.emplace_back(i);
				s[i]='1';
			}
		for(int i=0;i<zero.size();i++)
			if(k>=zero[i]-i){
				k-=(zero[i]-i);
				zero[i]=i;
			}
			else{
				zero[i]-=k;
				break;
			}
		for(int pos:zero)
			s[pos]='0';
		cout<<s<<'\n';
	}
}
```
