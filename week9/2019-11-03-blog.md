##Solution to yesterday's problem [Unsolvable](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/225/E):

###Problem Analysis:
The input here is really abnormal since why can we only find 40 solutions, especially it seems like there should be infinity solutions.

###Observation:
Let's first see if this equation is unsolvable, what property should $z$ hold. Consider $x=2k$ and $x=2k-1$, $k>0$, which means that $x$ is even and odd respectively. Then:$$2z+1=(2k+1)(2y+1) \ for \ x \ is \ even$$ $$z+1=k(2y+1) \ for \ x \ is \ odd$$
Then, we can easily know that if the equation is unsolvable, $z$ should be $2^t-1$ and $2^{t+1}-1$ is a prime. Therefore, we can find the first 40 Mersenne primes online and solve this problem.

###Implementation Process:

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

const int mod=1e9+7;


long long int power(long long int x,long long int b){
	long long int res=1;
	while(b){
		if(b&1)
			res=res*x%mod;
		x=x*x%mod;
		b>>=1;
	}
	return res;
}


int main(){
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	cout<<(power(2,p[n]-1)+mod-1)%mod<<endl;
}
