##Solution to yesterday's problem  [The Maximum Subtree](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1238/F):

###Problem Analysis:
The idea is to sort the array, and start with the initial maximum difference, and try decreasing it while we have operations left.
We need only 1 operation to decrement answer by one, if we increment the leftmost number. We can keep incrementing it until it becomes equal to the next number. After that, we need 2 operations (increment both of them) to decrement answer by one, and so on.
The same is symmetrical for the right side too.
So, we greedily move towards center from both ends together, minimizing the answer at each step.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n; 
  cin >> n;
  long long k; 
  cin >> k;
  vector<long long> a(n);
  for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
      cin>>a[i];
  }
  sort(a.begin(),a.end());  
  vector<long long> b(n - 1);
  for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
    b[i] = a[i + 1] - a[i];
  } 
  long long ans = a.back() - a[0];
  int l = 0, r = n - 2, p = 1;
  while (l < r) {
    long long take = min(k, (b[l] + b[r]) * p);
    ans -= take / p;
    k -= take;
    ++p, ++l, --r;
  }
  if (l == r) {
    long long take = min(k, b[l] * p);
    ans -= take / p;
    k -= take;
  }
  cout<<ans<<endl;
  
  return 0;
}
