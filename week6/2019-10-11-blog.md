##Solution to yesterday's problem  [Increasing Matrix](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1231/C):

###Problem Analysis:
According to the problem description, we know that 0 will not occur at the border of the matrix. Therefore, it is easy for us to tell the maximum value of each row and column, which are at the last row/column. Then we use the greedy and DP algorithm to construct every single value from the last row/column: $$f(i,j)=min(f(i+1,j),f(i,j+1)-1$$ In this ways, we can get all the values and the problem is solved. And by the way, don't forget to output -1 when it is impossible to construct a valid matrix.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

using std::min;

int main(){
	static int a[505][505];
	int n,m,i,j,sum=0;
	
	scanf("%d%d",&n,&m);
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
		for(j=1;j<=m;j++){
			scanf("%d",a[i]+j);
			sum+=a[i][j];
		}
	
	for(i=n;i>=1;i--)
		for(j=m;j>=1;j--)
			if(!a[i][j])
				sum+=a[i][j]=min(a[i+1][j],a[i][j+1])-1;
			else if(i!=n && a[i][j]>=a[i+1][j] || j!=m && a[i][j]>=a[i][j+1]){
				printf("-1\n");
				return 0;
			}
	
	printf("%d\n",sum);
	
	return 0; 
}
