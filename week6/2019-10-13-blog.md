##Solution to yesterday's problem  [The Maximum Subtree](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1238/F):

###Problem Analysis:
After drawing some segments on paper, you might observe the constraint that makes the tree good is tight. If we can find a property that can lead the tree to be good, we might have a way to solve this problem.

###Observation:
A quick observation is that a tree is good if it's a path plus some leafs appended to it. If this property is not satisfied, there is no segments that can form this tree since it must form a cycle. Since we are interested in a path, we can do dynamic programming on the subtrees to find the largest size of the good tree that has one end at the current vertex, and update the answer by merging the largest two answers on its children plus some leafs to it.

###Implementation Process:
For these kinds of multi-query problems, there is usually a total limit on the input to ensure the time complexity won't explode. Therefore, for every query we should only use the variables we need and clear them after using them. Otherwise, the clear operations might lead you into a time limit exceeded.

	dp[x]=edge[x].size()+biggest+(biggest==0?0:-1);
